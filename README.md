A personal site of Tien H. Vo, who loves to use and share tips about MUI (Material-UI) and Next.js.

## I write Articles
I started writing my very first article in November in 2021. I love sharing about my experiences, understanding about React and Next.js.

## I do videos on YouTube
I have a small YouTube channel named VoxyDev. I weekly create tutorial videos on Web Development.

## I create Courses
I love to teach, and I've create courses on Web Development, JavaScript, React, and more. I love being able to put the things I've learned into a package for others to learn from.
